**Swizzling** â€” changing image memory layout for better cache locality when accessing neighbor pixels.

**Homogeneous coordinate**
If homogeneous coordinate is set to 1 then the *translation* matrix will be applied
If homogeneous coordinate is set to 0 then the translation transformation will be ignored which is handful for direction vectors

**Bezier Curve definition**
![[Pasted image 20240919201724.png]]p0, p1, p2 are control points, that form the curve

The most popular is cubic Bezier Curve

Curve always remains inside convex hull so it is easy to tell curve's position by its control points.

Curve can be **transformed** by applying transformation to its control points.

Derivative of a cubic curve is quadratic curve that represents direction of a curve
